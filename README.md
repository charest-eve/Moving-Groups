Moving Groups

As a student researcher at Dickinson College, I contributed to a project focused on analyzing stellar motion data collected by the HIPPARCOS and Gaia spacecrafts. I gathered and processed this data to create visualizations that illustrated the movement of stellar groups through space. Our findings were presented at the American Astronomical Society's annual meeting.
